# Webcam Access on a Web Browser

Based on the DragonBoard™ 410c development board from Arrow Electronics, a demo for image acquisition and web release was developed using the Python language.
It is designed to demonstrate how to acquire images by camera and upload them to a web server deployed on DragonBoard 410c development board. Such images
should then be accessible by other devices through network.

This project is a simplified example of photo shooting and uploading, and can be conveniently integrated to a developer’s projects in order to realize real
time image acquisition and web release.
