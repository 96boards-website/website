Project Name: 96Boards and Gumstix GadgetDrone

Description: Gumstix has put together a working 96Boards drone using the Qualcomm DragonBoard 410c and the AeroCore 2 Mezzanine from Gumstix. 96Boards and the Gumstix AeroCore 2 card are used to fly a drone with PX4 R/C and wireless, telemetry, and video feed capabilities.

The drone has proven to be fully functional and can be found in action in several videos:
